Import posts from a Facebook Group to Wordpress. Each Facebook post becomes a post in Wordpress - includes imagery, comments and post content.

## Description

Import posts from a Facebook Group feed into posts in Wordpress.

* Each post in the feed becomes a post in Wordpress.
* Imports words, images, video and comments (including Emoji).
